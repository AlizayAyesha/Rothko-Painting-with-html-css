# Rothko Painting
This project aims to recreate the essence of a Rothko painting using HTML and CSS. Rothko, a renowned abstract expressionist artist, is known for his large color field paintings which often evoke deep emotional responses from viewers. In this project, we utilize basic HTML elements styled with CSS to simulate the atmosphere of a Rothko painting.

**Features:**<br>
_Canvas Simulation:_ The canvas is represented by a div element styled with CSS to resemble the texture of a painting surface. A blur effect is applied to simulate the dreamy quality often found in Rothko's works.<br> _Color Blocks:_ Different colored blocks are positioned on the canvas to mimic the simple yet impactful compositions found in Rothko's paintings. Each block is styled with CSS to have a distinct color and shape, reminiscent of Rothko's color field technique.<br> _Frame Design:_ The canvas is framed with a border to give it a polished look. The frame adds to the presentation of the artwork, making it feel like a completed piece ready for display.<br>
